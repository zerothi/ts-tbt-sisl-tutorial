To do so you just need to pass the argument `nkpt=[nkx, nky, nkz]` when creating the `HubabrdHamiltonian(...)` object. This argument will set the number of $\\mathbf k$-points along each direction in which the Hamiltonian will be sampled in k-space. I.e. if the system is periodic only along the $x$-axis, you should pass something like `nkpt=[nkx, 1, 1]`, where `nkx>1` (the larger this number is, the better the sampling and the slower the convergence process are)."
